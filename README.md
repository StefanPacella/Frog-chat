## Frog-chat a web-chat on tomcat.

I have created an entire web-chat that uses Tomcat 9 and Bootstrap.
This project was originally written in Italian, and even today, you can still find some Italian words in it. The project uses a cache with a reader-writer policy and acts as an intermediary between the requests and the DBMS. The schema is based on RESTful principles. The website is not vulnerable to SQL Injection and XSS attacks, there are some things that have not been implemented, such as the logout policy. To ease my development, i used algorithms that are not efficient, but of course, you have my permission to modify them. This project is released under the MIT license,
