## Frog-chat a web-chat on tomcat.

I have created an entire web-chat that uses Tomcat 9, RESTful and Bootstrap, this project is released under the MIT license, the website is not vulnerable to SQL Injection and XSS attacks, there are some things that have not been implemented, such as the logout policy.
